                Still Got Time - Dexter in the Newsagent
              </a>
            </h2>
            <p>
              As mentioned in my About page, this song is one of my favorites, and I listen to it
              nearly every day at this point. It's just a really good song, and I love the beat.

                Agora Hills - Doja Cat
              </a>
            </h2>
            <p>
              Say what you will about Doja Cat and her recent PR issues, but this song is a banger.
              I love the beat, and the lyrics are pretty good too if not a little strange at times.

                Souvenir - Bump Of Chicken
              </a>
            </h2>
            <p>
              One of the Spy x Family op's and it is still constantly stuck in my head from when I
              last watched the show. The beat is great and the vibes that go along with it are even
              better.

                I Wish You Cared - Xander
              </a>
            </h2>
            <p>
              Maybe a seemlingly strange addition to this list, but this has been my "study song"
              for as long as I can remember. Good lofi beat and the songs that are usually auto
              played after are just as good. A very good song if you need to sit down and do
              some work.

                Cherry Wine - Grentperez
              </a>
            </h2>
            <p>
              Just an all time classic. I've been listening to this song for years now and it
              never gets old. The beat is great and the lyrics are even better. A very good song
              to listen to if you're feeling down.

              </a>
            </h2>
            <p>
              Also one of my favorites for a while. Excelelnt beat and and lyrics. Very chill Song
              that I could listen to over and over again. Also Remi Wolf is ofc amazing.

              </a>
            </h2>
            <p>
              Another Remi Wolf favorite. Just a great beat with easy to sing lyrics. I love the
              vibes that this song gives off and it's just a great song to listen to whenever.

                Roomates - Malcolm Todd
              </a>
            </h2>
            <p>
              Found this one on Tik Tok a while back but still listen to it all the time. Great
              beat and lyrics. I love the chorus and the rest of the song is just as good.

                Breakup Season - Maya Delilah, Samm Henshaw
              </a>
            </h2>
            <p>
              A medium paced love song but I love the dynamic between the two singers. Just
              very pleasing to listen too - feels good on the ears. I love the chorus the most
              but once again the rest of the song is very good.

                Falling Behind - Laufey
              </a>
            </h2>
            <p>
              Honestly, should have been more Laufey songs on this list but they remind me of sad
              jujustu kaisen Tik Tok edits so I didn't want to add too many. This song is just
              a good listen whether you're trying to fall asleep, workout, or do anything at all.
